# DSA-Doubly Linked List  (Linear Data Structure)

A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure, which means that the elements are stored in a sequence and accessed in a linear order. The doubly linked list is a more flexible data structure than the singly linked list because it allows for traversal in both directions. The doubly linked list is used in many applications, including the implementation of stacks, queues, and other data structures.

The Doubly Linked Lists consist of a sequence of elements, where each element (called a node) contains three parts.

1. A data part-- The actual value stored in the node.
2. Next Pointer-- A pointer or reference to the next node in the sequence.
3. Previous Pointer-- A pointer or reference to the previous node in the sequence.

In a doubly linked list, each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes.

**|Prev | Data | Next |**

Example of a Doubly Linked List that contains the values of 1,2,3

**HEAD -> [null | 1 | -] <-> [- | 2 | -] <-> [- | 3 | null] -> TAIL**
